# ChatGPT + yEd Integration: Automating UML Generation

## Overview
This workflow demonstrates how ChatGPT can complement yEd by programmatically generating UML-compliant GraphML files that open seamlessly in yEd. It automates UML design while preserving full compatibility with yEd's native UML features.

---

## Key Benefits
1. **Automated UML Generation:** ChatGPT creates GraphML files containing UMLClassNodes, attributes, methods, stereotypes, and constraints.
2. **Dynamic Editing:** Probabilistic and decision-making objects can be added or updated iteratively without manual rework.
3. **Namespace-Safe Outputs:** Files are produced with correct namespaces (`xmlns:y`), ensuring yEd compatibility.
4. **Color-Coding by Stereotype:** ChatGPT applies semantic colors (Roles, Entities, Utilities) for instant visual grouping in yEd.
5. **Standards Integration:** Decision hooks and probability maps are encoded directly into UML for simulation-driven systems.

## Technical Approach
1. **yEd-Compatible UML Nodes:**
   - Uses `<y:UMLClassNode>` blocks with `<y:UML>` compartments for attributes, methods, stereotypes.
   - Includes `<y:EdgeLabel>` for labeled connections.

2. **Probability and Decision Modeling:**
   - Introduces utility classes (e.g., `Probability`, `ProcessDecode`) for stochastic simulation support.
   - Decision methods in each class delegate to central logic nodes, providing clean architecture diagrams.

3. **Namespaces & Tools:**
   - Files generated with `lxml.etree` to maintain XML namespace integrity.
   - Structured to include:
     - GraphML UML nodes
     - Edge connections
     - Color-coded stereotypes

4. **yEd Layout Synergy:**
   - Generated UML files leverage yEd’s **Radial, Hierarchical, and Organic layouts** for clear visualization.

---

## Example Use Case
**Restaurant Simulation UML:**
- 18 UML classes including operational roles, utilities (`Probability`, `ProcessDecode`), devices, and resources.
- Automated GraphML with radial layout applied in yEd provided an instant, production-ready system architecture diagram.
- Output used directly for simulation code generation (Java/Python).

---

## Why This Works Well
- **yEd excels at visualization, manual refinement, and layout.**
- **ChatGPT accelerates UML creation, iteration, and domain-specific customization.**
Together, they reduce hours of manual diagramming to minutes while maintaining UML rigor.

---

## Next Steps
- Offer pre-configured UML templates (Decision + Probability integrated) within yEd's library.
- Explore a ChatGPT → yEd API bridge for on-demand UML generation.
